# README
Just a quick devise views boostrapping with local :de and :en - as

Started with the main branch and a new rails 7 app. Created the branch devise_setup and found that turbo-rails aka hotwire and devise needed some adjustments.

The branch [devise_turbo_false](https://github.com/i-Captain/rails_7_devise_starter/tree/devise_turbo_false) disables the data attribute turbo to false in all generated devise:views

The branch [devise_turboable](https://github.com/i-Captain/rails_7_devise_starter/tree/devise_turboable) is a test after i watched Chris Olivers [How to use Devise with Hotwire & Turbo.js](https://gorails.com/episodes/devise-hotwire-turbo?autoplay=1) 

In the branch [devise_t_false_deploy](https://github.com/i-Captain/rails_7_devise_starter/tree/devise_t_false_deploy) i am following again a tutorial from [excid3](https://github.com/excid3). You find the details in the [README.md](https://github.com/i-Captain/rails_7_devise_starter/tree/devise_t_false_deploy/README.md)
